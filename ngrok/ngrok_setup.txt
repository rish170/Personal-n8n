ngrok Setup for Remote Access

ngrok is used to expose the locally running n8n instance
to the public internet for remote access and webhook execution.

Step 1: Install ngrok
ngrok is installed on Windows using the Microsoft Store.

Step 2: Authenticate ngrok
The ngrok authtoken is added using the following command:

ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>

(Note: The actual token is not committed to the repository for security reasons.)

Step 3: Start HTTP Tunnel
After the n8n container is running on port 5678, start ngrok with:

ngrok http 5678

Step 4: Public URL Generation
ngrok generates a public HTTPS URL that forwards traffic
to the local n8n server running at localhost:5678.

This public URL is used as:
- N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL
- WEBHOOK_URL

Purpose:
- Access n8n editor from any device
- Enable webhook-based workflows
- Allow remote automation execution while the local server is active
